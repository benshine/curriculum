## Status

 I rarely get to work on this project, so I'm noting the current status of it so that I won't be too confused the next time I look at it.

 Currently uses redux to manage state  with a few separates presentational components
 all defined in app.js

  this is pretty much exactly what is built in the egghead course,
  [getting started with Redux](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-redux-extracting-presentational-components-addtodo-footer-filterlink)
